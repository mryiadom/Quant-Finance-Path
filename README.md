# Quant-Finance-Path
A comprehensive 52-week quantitative finance curriculum focusing on derivative pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimisation using Python.
Quantitative Finance Roadmap: 12-Month Mastery
This repository documents my professional transition into Quantitative Finance. It serves as a technical portfolio encompassing financial mathematics, stochastic processes, and algorithmic implementation.

🏛️ Core Competencies
Mathematical Finance: Time Value of Money, Options Greeks, Black-Scholes, and Binomial Models.

Risk Analytics: Value at Risk (VaR), Expected Shortfall (ES), and Volatility Forecasting (GARCH).

Programming: Financial data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy.

Portfolio Theory: Mean-Variance Optimisation and the Efficient Frontier.
